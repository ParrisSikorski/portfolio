			<h3><strong>Hobbies</strong></h3>
			<p>I enjoy playing computer games like <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>  or <a href="http://everquest.com">Everquest</a>. Sports are also a big part of my life especially MSU sports. I was born and raised a Michigan State fan and have gone to six football games so far to support the spartans. This past fall I went to the Michigan State vs Oregon game in Eugene Oregon and plan to go to the rematch game this fall in East Lansing Michigan. I grew up playing soccer, football, and baseball. As well as non-team sports like surfing and snowboarding. I am currently training for my first triathlon.</p>
